# 🔐 Penetration Testing on DVWA

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a complete Penetration Testing assessment performed on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application). The objective of this project was to simulate real-world web application attacks, identify security vulnerabilities, exploit them in a controlled lab environment, and provide detailed remediation recommendations.
- The assessment follows a structured Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) methodology aligned with industry standards and OWASP guidelines.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform web application penetration testing in a safe lab environment
- Identify vulnerabilities aligned with OWASP Top 10
- Exploit security flaws to demonstrate real-world impact
- Document findings with risk ratings and remediation steps
- Strengthen understanding of ethical hacking methodologies

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- Nmap
- Nikto
- Metasploit Framework
- Browser Developer Tools

## 🔍 Vulnerabilities Identified
- The following vulnerabilities were tested and exploited:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS – Reflected & Stored)
- Command Injection
- Broken Authentication
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- File Upload Vulnerabilities
- Brute Force Attacks
- Security Misconfiguration
- Each vulnerability includes:

## 📖 Description

- ⚙️ Exploitation Steps
- 📸 Proof of Concept (PoC)
- 📊 Risk Rating (CVSS-based)
- 🛡️ Remediation Recommendations

## 🧪 Methodology
- The penetration testing process followed these phases:
- Reconnaissance & Information Gathering
- Scanning & Enumeration
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post-Exploitation Analysis
- Reporting & Risk Assessment

## 📊 Reporting
- A detailed penetration testing report was created including:
- Executive Summary
- Technical Findings
- Impact Analysis
- CVSS Risk Ratings
- Screenshots (PoC)
- Mitigation Strategies

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project was conducted strictly in a controlled lab environment using DVWA for educational and ethical purposes only.
Do not attempt these techniques on unauthorized systems.
